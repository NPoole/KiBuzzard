# KiBuzzard KiCad Plugin
    Note this plugin is currently a work in progress.
    
    Please ensure project is saved before playing with labels. 
    There may still be some bugs that cause KiCad to crash.

Adaption of Eagle based plugin [Buzzard](https://github.com/sparkfunX/Buzzard) for KiCad

This plugin lets you easily create labels in various fonts, and with inverted backgrounds.

## Compatibility
This plugin has been designed to work on all platforms (Win, Linux, Mac) and with both Current KiCad 5.1, 6.0 and Nightly Releases.

    Note: currently in v5 the labels are placed at 0,0 when created. 
    With Nightly they are copied to the clipboard and can be placed interactively.

## Installation

### KiCad Plugin and Content Manager (v6+)

Find KiBuzzard in the PCM, from the main KiCad window.
If you desire a newer release than what is currently available in the PCM, then follow the steps below.

### Manual install

Install the script in your KiCad scripting directory
You can find the location of scripting directories by opening a KiCad scripting terminal and running the following:

```python
import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.PLUGIN_DIRECTORIES_SEARCH)
```

Example on KiCad 6.00 Ubuntu (from KiCad-Nightly package):
```console
>>> import pcbnew; print(pcbnew.PLUGIN_DIRECTORIES_SEARCH)
/usr/share/kicad-nightly/scripting
/usr/share/kicad-nightly/scripting/plugins
/home/__USERNAME__/.config/kicad/6.00/scripting
/home/__USERNAME__/.config/kicad/6.00/scripting/plugins
/home/__USERNAME__/.local/share/kicad/6.00/scripting
/home/__USERNAME__/.local/share/kicad/6.00/scripting/plugins
```

You can either use git to download the plugin, or directly download as Zip.
```console
$ cd /home/__USERNAME__/.config/kicad/6.00
$ mkdir scripting
$ cd scripting
$ git clone https://github.com/gregdavill/KiBuzzard
```

    Note: `KiBuzzard` should be the root folder of the plugin, with this README in it, when downloading as a zip KiBuzzard may have been put into a subfolder.
```console
~/.config/kicad/6.00/scripting$ ls -l KiBuzzard/

```

For Arch Linux users is already a [kicad-kibuzzard-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kicad-kibuzzard-git/) package in the AUR.

## Custom fonts

You should be able to load in extra TrueType fonts into `KiBuzzard/buzzard/typeface`. 
You may need to reopen KiCad, and then the extra fonts should be visible in the font selection dropdown.

    Note: be sure to understand your PCB fabs capability when it comes to silkscreen resolution when selecting a custom font.
